- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukongL
- 👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack Development, UX Design, and Backend Frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Java development with Spring Framework, backend APIs with Django Rest Framework, dynamic front-end frameworks like React.js, and refining my UX design skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, backend development with Django and Spring, complex Java-based software development projects, and UX design initiatives that bridge code and user experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: liliane.haniel@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a passion for creating things—whether it's designing user experiences or crafting digital artwork.
